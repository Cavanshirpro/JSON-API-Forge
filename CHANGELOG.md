# Changelog

## 0.5.1 — 2026-09-06

- Advance the independent examples distribution, installers, generated catalog and workflow assets to v0.5.1.
- Stream bounded example files into deterministic ZIPs and reject symlinks, case collisions, oversized files and source changes during packaging.
- Use unique temporary archives and reject output inside source apps; clamp timestamps to the ZIP format's supported range.
- Stage one-app installs and reject existing targets, dangling links and symlink/junction parents.
- Add archive regression tests to Actions and make source manifests work identically in Git and extracted source packages.

- Added 20 deterministic large-domain systems with four resources, three operations and scoped workflow policies each.
- Added `EditorPluginRegistry` for bounded reviewed plugin metadata without automatic native-code execution.
- Added safe Bash and PowerShell one-project installers.
- Added a deterministic bounded ZIP builder with internal and external SHA-256 inventories.
