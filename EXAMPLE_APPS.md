# Copy-ready example applications

This branch keeps complete Forge applications under `app/`; `main` intentionally contains none. Each directory is independent, uses its own slug/API prefix and can be copied unchanged into another JSON API Forge checkout.

The catalog contains 25 named projects. The original five demonstrate specialized surfaces; the other twenty are deliberately large domain systems generated from a reviewed, deterministic source catalog. Every generated system contains four SQL resources, three operations (analytics, idempotent transition and assignment), operator/auditor roles, cache/rate-limit/protection policy, realtime events and an Editor graph.

| Application | Focus |
|---|---|
| `TaskBoard` | Filtered/searchable SQL CRUD, soft deletion and scoped roles |
| `GuildLedger` | Discord-style accounts plus atomic, idempotent balance operations |
| `RealtimeSupport` | Ticket CRUD plus bounded WebSocket/SSE notifications |
| `MediaLibrary` | Private local media, quotas, MIME/extension policy and collection metadata |
| `PublicCatalog` | Explicitly public, read-only JSON-file data source |
| `CommerceCore` | Order orchestration, fulfilment ownership and monetary rollups |
| `IdentityHub` | Identity lifecycle, policy records and auditable state changes |
| `ProjectOps` | Portfolio work, assignments, workflow history and dashboards |
| `LearningCampus` | Enrollment operations and bounded progress reporting |
| `ClinicFlow` | Synthetic care-operations workflow (not a medical-record system) |
| `FleetControl` | Vehicle lifecycle, dispatch and maintenance operations |
| `HotelOperations` | Reservation workflow, service hand-offs and revenue totals |
| `RestaurantNetwork` | Multi-location preparation and service-order flow |
| `WarehouseGrid` | Inventory batches, allocation and quantity aggregation |
| `SubscriptionPlatform` | Tenant subscription lifecycle and usage operations |
| `CreatorStudio` | Content production, review and publishing workflow |
| `TournamentEngine` | Match lifecycle, officials, rules and live updates |
| `IoTControlCenter` | Device control metadata and remediation workflows |
| `LogisticsNetwork` | Shipment/hub orchestration and exception handling |
| `CivicPortal` | Private civic case workflow and aggregate reporting |
| `ResearchVault` | Dataset stewardship, access policies and provenance |
| `HiringPipeline` | Candidate workflow, recruiter ownership and audit events |
| `IncidentCommand` | Incident response, runbooks and realtime command updates |
| `FinanceOps` | Synthetic dual-control batch operations and totals |
| `EditorPluginRegistry` | Forge-backed Editor plugin metadata, permissions and SHA-256 review state |

Except for the explicitly public `PublicCatalog`, each project uses a generated `<SLUG>_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_KEY`. Run `forge init`; do not hand-author shared credentials.

## Run examples with the independently owned runtime

```bash
git clone --branch main --single-branch https://github.com/Cavanshirpro/JSON-API-Forge.git JSON-API-Forge-main
git clone --branch exampleApps --single-branch https://github.com/Cavanshirpro/JSON-API-Forge.git JSON-API-Forge-examples
cp -R JSON-API-Forge-examples/app/. JSON-API-Forge-main/app/
cd JSON-API-Forge-main
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
forge init                               # creates strong local bootstrap secrets
forge validate
forge doctor
forge dev
```

Each project exposes its own documentation root at `/api/<slug>/v1/_docs`.

## Copy one application into another checkout

From this branch:

```bash
./scripts/install-example.sh TaskBoard /path/to/JSON-API-Forge/app
# Windows PowerShell:
.\scripts\install-example.ps1 -Name TaskBoard -Destination C:\path\to\JSON-API-Forge\app
```

The scripts refuse to overwrite an existing target. A plain directory copy works too. In the destination checkout run `forge init`, `forge validate`, then `forge dev`. Never copy the generated root `.env` or runtime `data/`; create fresh secrets and databases per installation.

The generated applications and release ZIP are reproducible from the examples checkout:

```bash
python scripts/generate_example_catalog.py --check
python scripts/build-example-bundle.py JSON-API-Forge-exampleApps-v0.5.0.zip
```

`smoke-example-apps.py` is intentionally executed by CI from a separate `main` checkout after the examples have been copied into it; it is not a standalone server.

`EditorPluginRegistry` is the reference backing service for the Editor's plugin catalog. It stores metadata and reviewed package digests; the Editor intentionally does not auto-download, auto-install or auto-enable native code.

These are development/reference configurations. Before production, use Redis-backed shared rate limiting where needed, set concrete trusted hosts/CORS origins, enable HTTPS, move SQLite workloads to a supported production database and run `forge doctor --production`.
