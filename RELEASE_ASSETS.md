# Python SDK release assets

Download the `JSON-API-Forge-python-library-v0.5.0` artifact from the successful `Python SDK build` Action. It contains:

- `json_api_forge_client-0.5.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- `json_api_forge_client-0.5.0.tar.gz`
- `JSON-API-Forge-python-library-v0.5.0-source.zip`
- `SHA256SUMS`

Verify checksums before upload. Publish the unchanged wheel and sdist to PyPI only after every required job is green. Attach the source ZIP and checksum file to the matching GitHub Release if desired. The workflow intentionally performs no publication.
