# MediaLibrary

[![Forge 0.5.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Forge-0.5.1-D4A017)](../../VERSION)
[![Example checks](https://github.com/YoungLionOrganization/JSON-API-Forge/actions/workflows/example-apps.yml/badge.svg?branch=exampleApps)](https://github.com/YoungLionOrganization/JSON-API-Forge/actions/workflows/example-apps.yml?query=branch%3AexampleApps)
[![Source available](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-source--available-555555)](../../LICENSE)

Private local media with owner quotas, batch and size bounds, MIME/extension allowlists, owner-scoped deduplication and SQL collection metadata.

## Install and run

Install the [main runtime](https://github.com/YoungLionOrganization/JSON-API-Forge/blob/main/INSTALL.md) at v0.5.1. From the exampleApps checkout:

```bash
bash scripts/install-example.sh MediaLibrary /path/to/JSON-API-Forge-main/app
```

On Windows use `scripts/install-example.ps1 -Name MediaLibrary -Destination C:\path\to\JSON-API-Forge-main\app`. Activate the main server's Python environment and run these commands **from its root**:

```bash
forge init
forge validate
forge doctor
forge dev
```

API prefix: `/api/media-library/v1`. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/media-library/v1/_docs` for the actual request schemas and endpoints.

After `forge init`, use `MEDIA_LIBRARY_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_KEY` to provision the role-specific API keys. Keep the generated `.env` private and retire bootstrap access as documented by the server.

## Try the example

Provision `media_contributor` and `media_reader` credentials, upload an allowed file within the declared limits, and inspect owner-scoped metadata/download behavior in the API docs.

Use `app.json` and the numbered `config/` files as the source of truth for permissions, limits and database/resource names. After adapting them, run `forge validate` and `forge doctor` again. The development reloader applies configuration changes automatically; use a deployment process with explicit migrations and backups in production.

## Boundaries and license

Signed public links are disabled. Review quotas and content policy, back up metadata with its media files, and do not assume a local directory is horizontally shared object storage.

This is a reference application. Review its policies and deployment dependencies before using real data.

Original example code is covered by `LicenseRef-JAF-SASH-1.1`.
