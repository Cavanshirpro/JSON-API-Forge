Support-ticket CRUD paired with a bounded `ticket-updates` channel over WebSocket and SSE.

## Install and run

Install the [main runtime](https://github.com/YoungLionOrganization/JSON-API-Forge/blob/main/INSTALL.md) at v0.5.1. From the exampleApps checkout:

```bash
bash scripts/install-example.sh RealtimeSupport /path/to/JSON-API-Forge-main/app
```

On Windows use `scripts/install-example.ps1 -Name RealtimeSupport -Destination C:\path\to\JSON-API-Forge-main\app`. Activate the main server's Python environment and run these commands **from its root**:

```bash
forge init
forge validate
forge doctor
forge dev
```

API prefix: `/api/realtime-support/v1`. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/realtime-support/v1/_docs` for the actual request schemas and endpoints.

After `forge init`, use `REALTIME_SUPPORT_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_KEY` to provision the role-specific API keys. Keep the generated `.env` private and retire bootstrap access as documented by the server.

## Try the example

Provision `support_agent` and `support_viewer` credentials. Inspect their different write/publish/subscribe permissions, open the channel, and exercise ticket CRUD plus explicit event publication.

Use `app.json` and the numbered `config/` files as the source of truth for permissions, limits and database/resource names. After adapting them, run `forge validate` and `forge doctor` again. The development reloader applies configuration changes automatically; use a deployment process with explicit migrations and backups in production.

## Boundaries and license

Separate publish and subscribe permissions, restrict browser origins, and keep queue/message/rate limits. Realtime is best-effort; this example is not a durable message broker.

This is a reference application. Review its policies and deployment dependencies before using real data.
